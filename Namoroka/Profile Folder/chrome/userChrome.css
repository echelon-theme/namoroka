/*
 * Hi! Are you looking to add another style on top of Namoroka?
 *
 * This file should probably not be modified directly. Custom changes can be added in
 * a safe way by creating a new file called "_chrome_user.css". This ensures that your
 * changes will not be overwrote by Namoroka updates.
 *
 * If you wish to contribute to Namoroka, then please contribute changes to the SCSS
 * source, which is put into _namoroka.css.
